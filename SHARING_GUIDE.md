## 💡 Tips

1. **Keep your computer awake** - The app stops working if your computer sleeps
2. **Stable internet** - Make sure you have a good internet connection
3. **Firewall** - Allow ngrok through Windows Firewall if prompted
4. **Share quickly** - Free ngrok URLs change each time you restart

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "ngrok not found"
- Make sure ngrok.exe is in your PATH
- Try running from the folder where ngrok.exe is located

### Problem: "Flask app not starting"
- Make sure you're in the correct directory
- Check if virtual environment exists: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`

### Problem: "Tunnel failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you've set up your ngrok auth token
- Try restarting ngrok

### Problem: "Friend can't access"
- Make sure you're sharing the HTTPS URL (not HTTP)
- Check if the tunnel is still active
- Make sure your Flask app is still running

## 🌟 Pro Tips

1. **For longer sessions**: Consider upgrading to ngrok paid plan
2. **Custom domains**: Pro ngrok plans allow custom subdomains
